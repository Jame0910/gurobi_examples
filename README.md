# gurobi_examples


This is a further note of the [Gurobi official examples](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/examples/index.html).

In my perspective, the best and fastest way to learn Gurobi is to get familiared with the official examples. 

In this repo, I will add more notes to explain the codes where the official guide did't offer.

You can view the jupyter notebook using the [nbviewer website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Copy my Github repo link and paste it into the website, then you can open notebook online, which is really convenient.
